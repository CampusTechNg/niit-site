									When I first came to NIIT, I was only looking forward to learn the basics of using a computer. But fortunately for me, I got a career as a software engineer who can develop Apps and Games for nearly every platform. I never knew Nigerians could develop Apps because I had the mindset that only the whites could make such, but NIIT changed that mindset. I now develop and teach people how to make Apps, thanks to NIIT.
